Chicago Quant Alley - Crypto Trading Simulator and Strategy Optimizer

1. Project Overview

This project is a modular, event-driven backtesting simulator designed to evaluate options trading strategies in a cryptocurrency setting. The strategy implemented for this simulator is a short straddle, where both call and put options at or near-the-money are sold simultaneously. The simulator uses historical BTC and option price data to simulate trade execution and evaluates profitability based on price movements.

3. Strategy Logic (Strategy.py)

Entry Time: 1 PM (13:00)

Instruments: Sell 0.1 lot of both call and put at closest ATM strike.

Exit Conditions:

If underlying moves >1% from entry price

OR if total PnL ≥ +500 or ≤ -500 INR

Trade Log: Each trade includes symbol, side, price, quantity, PnL, and timestamp

Dynamic Strike Selection: Implemented via get_closest_strikes() to find nearest matching strike from available symbol list based on spot price.

4. Simulator & Trade Execution (Simulator.py)

Loads all CSV data under data/YYYYMMDD/

Feeds every row of market data into the strategy

Simulates slippage (0.01%) and trade execution

Logs all buy/sell orders and quantities

Final PnL includes both realized and unrealized profits

After simulation, trade log is exported to CSV.

5. Analytics and Visualization (printStats.py)

Loads output/trade_log.csv

Converts it into a PnL time series

Computes metrics:

Mean & Median PnL

Sharpe Ratio

Max Drawdown

Value-at-Risk (95%)

Expected Shortfall (95%)

Generates plots:

pnl_plot.png: PnL over time

drawdown_plot.png: Drawdown curve

6. Sample Results

Entered straddle at 2024-06-01 13:00:00, underlying = 69000
Exited straddle at 2024-06-01 13:00:00, underlying = 70000, PnL = -80.01
Total P&L: -80.01

Performance Metrics:

Mean PnL: ₹-32.51

Median PnL: ₹-25.00

Std Dev: ₹39.48

Sharpe Ratio: -30.98

Max Drawdown: ₹-80.01

VaR 95%: ₹-47.01

Expected Shortfall (95%): ₹-50.01

7. Takeaways & Future Work

The simulator performs end-to-end trade simulation and evaluation.

Results show expected losses when underlying moves strongly (as straddles lose money in high volatility).

Future enhancements:

Add multi-day simulation capability

Introduce alternate strategies (e.g., long strangle, covered call)

Allow configurable position sizing

Integrate real-time charting using Plotly
